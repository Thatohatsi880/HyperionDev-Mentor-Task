## Written Assessment ##

### Section A: ###
####- This program groups anagrams together by creating a dictionary where the key is a sorted version of the anagram and the value is a list of all anagrams that match that key. It then returns the values of the dictionary as a list####

### Section B: ###
####- This program or project rather is one of my best favorite ones which shows just a formulation structure of my nasa-app with few view of the planet pictures I collected set below, which of course I am still on it.

sayNumber(0) ----> Zero.

### Section D:
#### Option 1: Mentorship
    ####Option 2: Java Support Task####
     On this one I would also encourage the student to keep the code simple, readable and well-commented.
     Lastly, I would ask the student to test the fixed code and provide feedback.
